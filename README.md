# Face-Mask-Detection
### Run the **face_mask.ipynb** for training the model
### after training the model run **prediction.py** file for indivial detection, but for live detection for multiple faces run **main.py** file
### Here i have used MTCNN to detect multiple faces which is than passed to the model for inference and than outputs are displayed on frames through opencv.
